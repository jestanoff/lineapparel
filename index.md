## WHAT WE DO

We connect fashion brands with sophisticated and licensed garment manufacturers in South - East Europe.

Our carefully nominated and trusted partner - manufacturers are based in Macedonia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia and Bulgaria and are fully equipped with high tech machinery making the manufacturing process easier, sustainable and more efficient.

We work with multiple factories specialised in producing different types of garments such as ladies, mens and children wear, outerwear, workwear, bedding, shoes, leather garments etc.

## SERVICES

We offer CMT (Cut - Make -Trim) services and carefully overlook the whole process of production while providing constant updates to our customers.

We translate the whole documentation for the orders making sure that accurate information is passed to the nominated factory. Constant liaising with both partner-manufacturers and clients efficiently is our top priority, as this helps us be transparent at all times and to ensure the manufacturing process is meeting all of the requested quality standards and deadlines.

Our QC engineer is providing insight from both inline and final QC inspection directly to us so we are sure we deliver the best quality to our customers.

We are happy to organise the process of import and export and can assist with the whole logistics procedure when needed, using only trusted and reputable local logistics companies.

## HOW WE WORK
Once we receive a request from a customer, we carefully shortlist a few of the factories which are specialised in manufacturing the needed product.

The technical teams review the request and then we are able to offer a price based on product complexity, deadlines and order quantity.

Our partner - manufacturers work with different MOQ and this can be negotiated to satisfy both sides needs.
Once we choose the factory and agree to all of the terms for the order, the factory produces a PPS (Pre- Production Sample) and when this gets approved by our customers, we are ready to start the bulk production.


## SUSTAINABILITY
We do care for our planet and our people therefore we only partner with manufacturers and fashion brands who have the same values.

Our partner-manufacturers are licensed with ISO or equivalents and are regularly audited by us and other professional bodies. We are proud to say that together we are able to follow strict sustainability policies, looking after the people we work with and making the fashion industry reach its goals for better sustainability so we are kinder on our planet.

Most of our manufacturing facilities are built in an energy-efficient manner according to all EU standards, with their own solar systems for independent green electricity and hot water, updated environmental protection protocols and fire protection protocols. Air-conditioned working halls, modern changing rooms and lounges and Covid safe working environment.
