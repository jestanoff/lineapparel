        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>We connect fashion brands with sophisticated and licensed garment manufacturers in Southeast Europe.</p>
        <p>
          Our carefully nominated and trusted partner - manufacturers are based in Macedonia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia and
          Bulgaria and are fully equipped with high tech machinery making the manufacturing process easier, sustainable
          and more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work with multiple factories specialised in producing different types of garments such as ladies, mens and
          children wear, outerwear, workwear, bedding, shoes, leather garments etc.
        </p>

      <section class="services">
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
          We offer CMT (Cut - Make -Trim) services and carefully overlook the whole process of production while
          providing constant updates to our customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We translate the whole documentation for the orders making sure that accurate information is passed to the
          nominated factory. Constant liaising with both partner-manufacturers and clients efficiently is our top
          priority, as this helps us be transparent at all times and to ensure the manufacturing process is meeting all
          of the requested quality standards and deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our QC engineer is providing insight from both inline and final QC inspection directly to us so we are sure we
          deliver the best quality to our customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are happy to organise the process of import and export and can assist with the whole logistics procedure
          when needed, using only trusted and reputable local logistics companies.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>How we work</h3>
        <p>
          Once we receive a request from a customer, we carefully shortlist a few of the factories which are specialised
          in manufacturing the needed product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technical teams review the request and then we are able to offer a price based on product complexity,
          deadlines and order quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our partner - manufacturers work with different MOQ and this can be negotiated to satisfy both sides needs.
          Once we choose the factory and agree to all of the terms for the order, the factory produces a PPS (Pre-
          Production Sample) and when this gets approved by our customers, we are ready to start the bulk production.
        </p>

        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
        <p>
          We do care for our planet and our people therefore we only partner with manufacturers and fashion brands who
          have the same values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our partner-manufacturers are licensed with ISO or equivalents and are regularly audited by us and other
          professional bodies. We are proud to say that together we are able to follow strict sustainability policies,
          looking after the people we work with and making the fashion industry reach its goals for better
          sustainability so we are kinder on our planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of our manufacturing facilities are built in an energy-efficient manner according to all EU standards,
          with their own solar systems for independent green electricity and hot water, updated environmental protection
          protocols and fire protection protocols. Air-conditioned working halls, modern changing rooms and lounges and
          Covid safe working environment.
